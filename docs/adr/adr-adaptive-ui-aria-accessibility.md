# ADR: Implement Adaptive UI and ARIA Attributes for Accessibility

The current interface of the music application is built on React components, but:

- Users with disabilities (e.g., low vision or non-visual) face difficulties with keyboard navigation and screen readers.
- Dynamic components (player, track list, pop-up modals) do not announce status changes via ARIA Live Regions.
- The mobile interface does not fully consider adaptive design (focus states, touch target sizes), making interaction harder for users with motor impairments.

Lack of a clear accessibility strategy results in degraded UX for some users and risks non-compliance with WCAG standards.

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive accessibility initiative consisting of two main parts:

#### Adaptive UI (Adaptive Layout & Focus Management)

- Ensure responsive design with minimum touch target sizes (at least 44×44px) and sufficient spacing.
- Add visible focus indicators for all interactive elements (outline or box-shadow with a high-contrast color).
- Provide a skip-to-content link at the top of the page for quick keyboard navigation.
- Define a logical tab order (tabindex) for sequential focus transitions.

#### ARIA Attributes & Semantic Markup

- Use semantic HTML elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`) instead of `<div>` for interactive regions.
- Add ARIA roles and labels:

    - `aria-label="Play track"` for icon-only buttons.
    - `aria-hidden="true"` for purely decorative elements.
    - `aria-live="polite"` for dynamic announcements (e.g., track changes).

- Ensure accessible form fields using `<label>` and `aria-describedby` for error messages.
- Apply `aria-checked`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-selected` on relevant components (checkboxes, accordions, tabs).

## Rationale

- Inclusive Design. Accessibility is a core aspect of quality UX—users of all abilities should have equal access to features.
- Standards Compliance. Meeting WCAG reduces legal risks and improves brand reputation.
- Consistency. A centralized ARIA and adaptive UI approach ensures uniform accessibility across the application.

## Status: Proposed

## Consequences

**Positive**

- Enhanced Accessibility: Better support for screen reader and keyboard users.
- Improved Mobile UX: Larger touch targets and clear focus states.
- Standards Compliance: Alignment with WCAG and ARIA Authoring Practices.
- Cleaner Code: Semantic markup and ARIA best practices lead to more maintainable code.

**Negative**

- Additional Development Effort: Refactoring existing components and writing tests.
- QA Overhead: Need to integrate accessibility testing (e.g., axe-core) and manual validation.
- Design Updates: Design mockups may require adjustments for focus indicators and layouts.
